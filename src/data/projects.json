The guys showed up prepared with a bunch of equipment and ready to go. Their instructions were very clear, and had great ideas of their visions for the video. They were very flexible and understanding of our situation and space and made it all work. Even though our toddler was crying for my wife and not letting them shoot, they still managed to work around that and produce a video that impressed us. We had no idea how good our food looked until we saw the video. I am grateful for their honest professional service and will be sure to use them for the future marketing projects.
